        ///             Problem: The problem was that for our new capture Toast messages (`%2$@ is no longer captured by Mac Mouse Fix\nThe button now works as if Mac Mouse Fix was disabled`),
        ///                 the second line was longer than the first, which made it not feel like its 'secondary' to the first line anymore.
