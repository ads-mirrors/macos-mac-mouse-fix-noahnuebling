    ///     - [ ] Set widths for Turkish

    /// Determine width for this tab
    ///     Discussion: [Sep 2025]
    ///         Before: We used to control the tab width through the linebreaks in the hints.
    ///         Problem: But that means localizers need to 'design' the tab width – but without being able to see what their choice looks like in-app (Unless they're building from source)
    ///         Solution: So now we're hardcoding the tab-width in code instead! [Sep 2025]
    ///             Con: If localizers manually choose linebreaks, they can set them where it feels smooth and helps parse the text. This is no longer possible when we automate linebreaks.
    ///                 Pro: But since the hints are very short sentences, it shouldn't matter too much.
    ///                 Pro: Also, we can still try to set the programmatic width such that the linebreaks don't happen in places that are too awkward.
    ///         Alternative approaches to hardcoding widths:
    ///             - I tried finding some specific margins we could constraint with autolayout to make the layout look good in any language, but I couldn't. I think what makes the layout look good is a complex interplay between whitespaces and distribution of visual weight and proportions and stuff – just hardcoding the width of the entire layout seems the most pragmatic solution. [Sep 2025]
    ///                 - Update: we ended up making everything 350 wide ... Not sure what's going on but it looks good [Sep 2025]
    
    /// How to choose a hardcoded tab-width: [Sep 2025]
    ///     - Pick what looks good in English
    ///     - If there are awkward line-wrappings or truncations, make wider
    ///         - Don't forget sections that are hidden by default (macOSHint)
    ///         - Text under 'Scrolling > Keyboard Modifiers:' can't wrap, so make sure it doesn't truncate. [Sep 2025]
