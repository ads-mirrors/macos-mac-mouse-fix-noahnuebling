/// Log
///     [Sep 12 2025] I recently changed the look of the AddField to match NSPrimaryBox, mostly to look nice on macOS Tahoe.
///         However, I've now decided to activate `UIDesignRequiresCompatibility` for the next MMF update (3.0.8).
///             When using `UIDesignRequiresCompatibility`, the contrast between the NSBox and the window background is kinda too low!
///                 Design issues with using NSPrimaryBox with `UIDesignRequiresCompatibility`:
///                 - Contrast is fine on a small box, but the box is so wide, that your peripheral vision can't see the edges when you look at the '+' icon in the middle.
///                 - The '+' icon maybe also now feels too dark?
///                     - On MMF 2, we also used an NSPrimaryBox, but with a lighter '+' icon.
///                     - But if we make it lighter, then the Add Field has even less visual weight.
///         -> Rolling back the NSPrimaryBox refactor by putting it in `AddField_New.swift`. Reverting `AddField.swift` to pre 7a3be8871085c7109f7042b9d213d543ba251fdb. (Where we started the NSPrimaryBox refactor.)

/// Old notes from `updateColors()`
///     (That function has now been deleted [Aug 2025])
///     This explain the history of how we used to handle colors and how we arrived at the current approach (Using an `NSVisualEffectView`) [Aug 2025]
///     Old Notes:
///         Explanation / why this is complicated [Aug 2025]
///         We want the AddField to simply look like a NSPrimaryBox with a '+' in the middle.
///         And that's exactly what the AddField was in MMF 2
///         However, in MMF 3, we wanted to a an effect where the AddField raises slightly when you hover over it. The 'raise' effect applies a shadow to the AddField.
///         Problem:
///             NSPrimaryBox is transparent, so when you apply a shadow to make it look raised up, it just looks blurry!
///         Solution ideas:
///         - Apply non-transparent custom colors
///             -> but those don't support wallpaper tinting, which ends up looking broken.
///         - Override draw()
///             - Old comment said it breaks desktop tinting even if we just call super.draw() [Aug 2025]
///         - Choose specific *system* NSColors for which NSBox *does* enable wallpaper tinting:
///             -> The solution we shipped for MMF 3
///                 – This made the code a bit more complicated and less maintainable since we have to draw an NSCustomBox which emulates an NSPrimaryBox. We also didn't manage to perfectly emulate the look, since only 4 NSColors were available (See below)
///         - Try to render a custom NSShadow to a bitmap and then draw that
///             -> Too complicated (See 35742760e0bb0c126e16183f11f65532953822cb)
///         - Set .windowBackgroundColor to the NSBox's CAlayer
///             -> This allows you to use NSPrimaryBox instead of NSCustomBox, which simplifies things.
///             -> Almost works but also doesn't support wallpaper tinting.
///         - Try to find some private API that gives you the 'wallpaperTintColor' and then mix that in with your NSColors
///             -> I don't think this exists. Evidence:
///                 - When you set one of the special system colors that enable wallpaper tinting to NSBox, the NSBox will actually secretly insert an *NSVisualEffectView* as its subview. Also, other views than NSBox don't support wallpaper tinting at all. So it seems wallpaper tinting always requires an NSVisualEffectView and cannot be done at the NSColor level (Which would be much simpler and more flexible, and which the NSColor docs kinda made me think)
///                     Also see: Disassembly of `[_NSBoxMaterialCapableCustomView _updateSubviews]` on macOS Tahoe Beta 8
///                 - This kind of makes sense from a security perspective. If apps could directly access the colors of the windows behind them, then they could possibly reconstruct a sharp image of the background-windows via "multi-frame super-resolution" techniques. I assume that, instead, the `NSVisualEffectBlendingModeBehindWindow` happens in that background process that does the CALayer rendering or whatever. [Aug 2025]
///         - Take a screenshot of a tinted view and then sample the color to get the 'wallpaperTintColor' to mix with your NSColors.
///             -> This could work – IIRC, we're already taking such screnshots for the ResizingTabWindow transitions ... but that's using the deprecated CGWindowListCreateImage() API.
///         - Put our own NSVisualEffectView behind / inside the NSBox
///             -> Since this is what NSBox does natively (See above), it may be the most robust approach.
///             -> This way we could simply keep using NSPrimaryBox, to get the desired styling with little effort
///             -> Changed to this approach after MMF 3.0.7
///

///                 - Here, we tried to render the NSShadow to a bitmap (See above)
///                 - We also found 4 NSColors for which NSBox enables wallpaper tinting: .controlBackgroundColor, .textBackgroundColor, .underPageBackgroundColor, .windowBackgroundColor
///                     (found them by searching for 'background', maybe there are more)
///             - The commit before we removed all the old comments in `updateColors()`, and wrote one, comprehensive comment up top [Aug 2025] e7fc400a0ac84baba4b9ad2548f3cdecf906272c

///             - `[NSAppearance performAsCurrentDrawingAppearance:]` -> This lets you correctly 'flatten' an NSColor to a CGColor or RGB while respecting darkmode/lightmode

///                 - Didn't end up using this (Can't support desktop tinting – need `NSVisualEffectView` for that I think.
///
///         Sidenotes:
///             - We could simplify some of the `updateColors()` code using `+[NSColor colorWithName:dynamicProvider:]` instead of listening to darkmode changes directly. However, that had a bug that broke desktop tinting on earlier Tahoe Betas until we filed FB18739714 with Apple. (Thanks to that Apple Engineer!) (I assume it was also broken on Sequoia, but I didn't test.)
