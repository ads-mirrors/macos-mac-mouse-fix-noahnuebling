# Capturing of the Scroll Wheel

Just like Mac Mouse Fix takes captures mouse buttons (See '[Captured Mouse Buttons](<../../Support/Guides/CapturedButtonsMMF3.md>)'), it also **captures the scroll wheel**.

And just like with buttons, you can prevent capturing of the scrollwheel by configuring the settings in Mac Mouse Fix in a specific way.

There are less reasons to prevent Mac Mouse Fix from capturing the scroll wheel compared to buttons,
but it may be useful if you'd like another app like [MOS](https://mos.caldis.me/) to handle scrolling on your mouse instead of MMF, or if you prefer completely native scrolling behavior.

**To disable capturing of the scrollwheel**: Go to the 'Scrolling' tab and set all the settings to match the native scrolling behavior in macOS. (Smoothness: Off, Speed: macOS, etc.)
After doing that, you should see a notification that tells you that scrolling is no longer captured by Mac Mouse Fix.

Now when you scroll, Mac Mouse Fix will use no more CPU when you're scrolling. And it will not change the behavior or interfere in any way.

<!--
- Consideration: Should we call it 'capturing' for the scrollwheel? 
    - Contra: MMF doesn't hide the scroll-events or prevent any default-actions in the same way it does for mouse buttons. 
    - Pro: Capturing is just used like 'Intercepting' by us. The 'hiding from other apps' thing that happens for buttons isn't inherent

# Capturing of the Scroll Wheels

Just like Mac Mouse Fix takes control of mouse buttons, it also takes control of the scroll wheel.

And just like with buttons, you can prevent capturing of the scrollwheel by configuring the settings in Mac Mouse Fix in a specific way.

There are less reasons to prevent Mac Mouse Fix from capturing the scroll wheel, 
but it may be useful if you'd like another app like [MOS]() to handle scrolling on your mouse instead of MMF.

To disable capturing of the scrollwheel, go to the 'Scrolling' tab and set all the settings to match the native scrolling in macOS (Smoothness: Off, Speed: macOS, etc.)
After doing that, you should see a notification that tells you that scrolling is no longer captured by Mac Mouse Fix.

Now when you scroll, Mac Mouse Fix will not intercept the scrolling at all. It will not use any CPU when you're scrolling. And it will not change the behavior or interfere in any way.
