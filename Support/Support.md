[Aug 2025] We thought about having a section here saying:
    "Only available in {{only_in_english_2}} – but feel free to write in your language!"

... But I decided to omit that, since this link isn't really about the 'content' which the user may not want to click on if they can't understand the language, but just about reaching out. Also, we plan to localize the form at some point, so it being "English only" is temporary.

<!-- Could mention that if they open an Issue others might help them ... But except for very widespread issues that's unlikely. So maybe bad to set high expectations? -->

<!-- Ideas: 
    - [Jul 2025] Apple support docs just have thumbs up thumbs down at the bottom and if you click thumbs down you get a text box to enter feedback. That's kinda nice. 
    - GitHub docs has a 'Submit a pull request' link at the bottom that takes you directly to the template file for the support doc on GitHub... I think our audience is not technical enough for that? I looked at some random doc on GitHub and the commit history was all GitHub employees... This seems unlikely to work.
    - GitHub docs have a 'Ask the community' link at the bottom, but that's what we had with GitHub Discussions for years and it didn't work.

    - Maybe make it a form: "I Still Have Questions After Viewing Help Content!\n\nWhat questions do you still have?\n\n(Please fill in here)
        - This would actually be easier to make by prefilling an email instead updating Feedback Assistant. Maybe we could make it a prefilled email for now, and later update. Maybe funnel through redirect.macmousefix.com to make it (slightly) easier to update later?
