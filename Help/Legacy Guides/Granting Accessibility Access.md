To use Mac Mouse Fix you'll have to grant it 'Accessibility Access'.

### 1. Issue where Accessibility Access is enabled but Mac Mouse Fix doesn't recognize that

Sometimes 'Mac Mouse Fix Helper' will show up as enabled in the list at 'System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility' but Mac Mouse Fix will keep asking you to grant Accessibility Access.

<img width="600" align="center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40808343/198885178-a321eabd-308a-4b23-865d-1bd475c79cd5.png">

#### Why does this issue occur?

I'm not sure but it seems that sometimes the macOS Accessibility Access database doesn't update properly after you update Mac Mouse Fix. 
See [this GitHub Issue](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/412) for more information.

#### Solution

If you encounter this issue, you can still grant Accessibility Access like so:

1. Go to 'System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility'
   - You can get there quickly by clicking on "Open 'Privacy & Security' Settings" in Mac Mouse Fix
   - In the video, I then click on the 'Mac Mouse Fix Helper' toggle repeatedly. This is to demonstrate that the toggle doesn't work, it is not a neccessary step of the solution.
2. If you're using macOS 12 Monterey or older, click the lock in the lower left and then enter your password to unlock System Preferences
3. Delete the entry for 'Mac Mouse Fix Helper' from the Accessibility list by selecting it and then clicking the minus (-) button at the bottom of the list
4. Go back to the Mac Mouse Fix window, then click the Mac Mouse Fix Icon while holding the Shift (⇧) key to reveal 'Mac Mouse Fix Helper' in the Finder
5. Drag and drop 'Mac Mouse Fix Helper' from the Finder to the Accessibility List in System Preferences
6. You should now be able to use Mac Mouse Fix!

### 2. Issue where 'Mac Mouse Fix Helper' won't show up in System Preferences

Sometimes, 'Mac Mouse Fix Helper' doesn't show up in the list at 'System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility' preventing you from granting Accessibility Access to it.

#### Why does this issue occur?

I'm not sure why this issue occurs. I assume that it's a bug in macOS. If you have any ideas what else might cause it let me know!

#### Solution
If you encounter this issue, you can still grant Accessibility Access like this:

### Notes on changes to System Settings under macOS 13 Ventura

Apple rewrote the 'System Preferences' app for macOS 13 Ventura and renamed it to 'System Settings'. This leads to a few caveats for this guide:

- In several places the guide refers to a the list at 'System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility'. On macOS 12 Monterey and below you can find this list under 'System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility' instead.
- The video footage and images for this Guide stem from the new System Settings introduced in macOS 13 Ventura. Things will look a little different under macOS 12 Monterey and below but the same issues can occur and the same solutions apply.
