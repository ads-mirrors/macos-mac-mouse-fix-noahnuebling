## Still have questions?

Reach out [here](https://redirect.macmousefix.com/?locale=th&target=mmf-feedback-help-content)!

I don't respond to all feedback, and when I do it might take me a while. I'm sorry about that. But I *will* read your feedback and do my best to improve the experience of using Mac Mouse Fix! 

<!-- Could mention that if they open an Issue others might help them ... But except for very widespread issues that's unlikely. So maybe bad to set high expectations? -->

<!-- Ideas: 
    - [Jul 2025] Apple support docs just have thumbs up thumbs down at the bottom and if you click thumbs down you get a text box to enter feedback. That's kinda nice. 
    - GitHub docs has a 'Submit a pull request' link at the bottom that takes you directly to the template file for the support doc on GitHub... I think our audience is not technical enough for that? I looked at some random doc on GitHub and the commit history was all GitHub employees... This seems unlikely to work.
    - GitHub docs have a 'Ask the community' link at the bottom, but that's what we had with GitHub Discussions for years and it didn't work.

    - Maybe make it a form: "I Still Have Questions After Viewing Help Content!\n\nWhat questions do you still have?\n\n(Please fill in here)
        - This would actually be easier to make by prefilling an email instead updating Feedback Assistant. Maybe we could make it a prefilled email for now, and later update. Maybe funnel through redirect.macmousefix.com to make it (slightly) easier to update later?
