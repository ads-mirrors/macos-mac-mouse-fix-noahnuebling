/// This file offers methods for creating NSAttributedString instances that display an SFSymbol through an NSImage Attachment.
///
/// It's also used to create NSAttributedStrings containing custom symbols (E.g. "CoolMenuBarIcon" as of 06.09.2024) (Therefore, perhaps, we should change the class name to not contain 'SFSymbols' )
///
/// Fallback mechanism:
///     There's a fallback mechanism where we set some plain NSString as the accessibilityDescription of the attached NSImage. Then we can use `[NSAttributedString(Additions) -stringWithAttachmentDescriptions]` to convert the NSAttributedString to a pure NSString but with the NSImage attachments replaced by their respective `accessibilityDescription`.
///
///     How we use this features is that we're setting the fallbackString of the SF Symbol image  to the unicode character for the SF Symbol. Then we ship a special font with MMF that can render those unicode characters. This allows us to use SF Symbols even inside of tooltips, where NSAttributedStrings are not possible.
///     Before this improved fallback mechanism was introduced (as I'm writing the new fallback mechanism, 3.0.2 is the latest release) we used to fallback to strings that looked like `<Increase Brightness Key>`. At the time of writing, we only really use this fallback stuff to display tooltips containing SF Symbols that appear on Apple Keyboard Keys.
///
/// Discussion:
///     Now that we ship the special font (CoolSFSymbols.otf), which can display SF Symbol unicode characters, you might think we'd want to do away with the NSImage attachments for displaying SFSymbols altogether. We might do that at some point, however, for now I wanna stick with the tried and true method, also, we already spent a lot of time perfecting the way that the NSImage attachments render and I think using unicode might be worse. Also, the more symbols we wanna render with CoolSFSymbols.otf the bigger we have to make the font file, althogh it'll probably stay very small (currently at 6 KB, able to render 10-20 symbols at regular weight.)
