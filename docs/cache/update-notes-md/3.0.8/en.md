Mac Mouse Fix **3.0.8** solves UI issues and more.

### **UI Issues**

- Fixed a bug where the 'Free days are over' notification would be stuck in a screen corner.
    - I'm sorry about that bug! I hope it wasn't too annoying. And thanks to [Sashpuri](https://github.com/Sashpuri) and others for reporting it.
- Disabled the new design on macOS 26 Tahoe. Now the app will look and function just like it did on macOS 15 Sequoia. 
    - I did this because some of Apple's redesigned UI elements don't work properly yet, which caused some issues on the 'Buttons' tab. For example, the '-' buttons weren't always clickable.
    - The UI may look a little outdated on macOS 26 Tahoe now. But it should be fully functional and polished just like before â€“ I thought that would be more important to users.


### **UI Polish**

- Disabled the green traffic light button in the main Mac Mouse Fix window.
    - The button was unnecessary. It didn't actually do anything, since the window cannot be resized manually.
- Fixed an issue where some of the horizontal lines in the table on the 'Buttons' tab were too dark under macOS 26 Tahoe.
- Fixed a bug where the "Primary Mouse Button can't be used" message on the 'Buttons' tab would sometimes be cut off under macOS 26 Tahoe.
- Fixed a typo in the German interface. Courtesy of GitHub user [i-am-the-slime](https://github.com/i-am-the-slime). Thanks!
- Solved an issue where the MMF window would sometimes briefly flash at the wrong size when opening the window on macOS 26 Tahoe.

### **Other Changes**

- Improved behavior when trying to enable Mac Mouse Fix while multiple instances of Mac Mouse Fix are running on the computer. 
    - Mac Mouse Fix will now try to disable the other instance of Mac Mouse Fix more diligently. 
    - This may improve behavior in some edge cases where Mac Mouse Fix couldn't be enabled before.
- Under-the-hood changes and cleanup.
