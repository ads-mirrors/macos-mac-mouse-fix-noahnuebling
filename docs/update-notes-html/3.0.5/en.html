<p>Mac Mouse Fix <strong>3.0.5</strong> fixes several bugs, improves

performance, and adds a bit of polish to the app.<br />

It’s also compatible with macOS 26 Tahoe.</p>

<h3 id="improved-simulation-of-trackpad-scrolling">Improved Simulation

of Trackpad Scrolling</h3>

<ul>

<li>The scrolling system can now simulate a two-finger tap on the

trackpad to make applications stop scrolling.

<ul>

<li>This fixes an issue when running iPhone or iPad apps, where

scrolling would often keep going after the user chose to stop.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Fixed inconsistent simulation of lifting fingers off the trackpad.

<ul>

<li>This may have caused suboptimal behavior in some situations.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<h3 id="macos-26-tahoe-compatibility">macOS 26 Tahoe Compatibility</h3>

<p>When running the macOS 26 Tahoe Beta, the app is now usable, and most

of the UI works correctly.</p>

<h3 id="performance-enhancement">Performance Enhancement</h3>

<p>Improved performance of the Click and Drag to “Scroll &amp; Navigate”

gesture.<br />

In my testing, CPU usage has been reduced by ~50%!</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>During the “Scroll &amp; Navigate” gesture, Mac Mouse Fix draws a

fake mouse cursor in a transparent window, while locking the real mouse

cursor in place. This ensures that you can keep scrolling the UI element

that you started scrolling on, no matter how far you move your

mouse.</p>

<p>The improved performance was achieved by turning off the default

macOS event handling on this transparent window, which wasn’t used

anyway.</p>

<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>

<li>Now ignoring scroll events from Wacom drawing tablets.

<ul>

<li>Before, Mac Mouse Fix was causing erratic scrolling on Wacom

tablets, as reported by <span class="citation"

data-cites="frenchie1980">@frenchie1980</span> in GitHub Issue <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/1233">#1233</a>.

(Thanks!)</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Fixed a bug where the Swift Concurrency code, which was introduced

as part of the new licensing system in Mac Mouse Fix 3.0.4, didn’t run

on the correct thread.

<ul>

<li>This caused crashes on macOS Tahoe, and it also likely caused other

sporadic bugs around licensing.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Improved robustness of the code that decodes offline licenses.

<ul>

<li>This works around an issue in Apple’s APIs that caused offline

license validation to always fail on my Intel Mac Mini. I assume that

this happened on all Intel Macs, and that it was the reason why the

“Free days are over” bug (which was already addressed in 3.0.4) still

occurred for some people, as reported by <span class="citation"

data-cites="toni20k5267">@toni20k5267</span> in GitHub Issue <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/1356">#1356</a>.

(Thank you!)

<ul>

<li>If you experienced the “Free days are over” bug, I’m sorry about

that! You can get a refund <a

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<h3 id="ux-improvements">UX Improvements</h3>

<ul>

<li>Disabled dialogs that provided step-by-step solutions for macOS bugs

that prevented users from enabling Mac Mouse Fix.

<ul>

<li>These issues only occurred on macOS 13 Ventura and 14 Sonoma. Now,

these dialogs only appear on those macOS versions where they are

relevant.</li>

<li>The dialogs are also a bit harder to trigger – before, they

sometimes showed up in situations where they weren’t very helpful.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Added an “Activate License” link directly on the “Free days are

over” notification.

<ul>

<li>This makes activating a Mac Mouse Fix license even more

hassle-free!</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<h3 id="visual-enhancements">Visual Enhancements</h3>

<ul>

<li>Slightly improved the look of the “Software Update” window. Now it

fits better with macOS 26 Tahoe.

<ul>

<li>This was done by customizing the default look of the “Sparkle

1.27.3” framework which Mac Mouse Fix uses to handle updates.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Fixed issue where the text at the bottom of the About tab was

sometimes cut off in Chinese, by making the window slightly wider.</li>

<li>Fixed the text at the bottom of the About tab being slightly

off-center.</li>

<li>Fixed a bug that caused the space under the “Keyboard Shortcut…”

option on the Buttons tab to be too small.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="under-the-hood-changes">Under-The-Hood Changes</h3>

<ul>

<li>Removed dependency on the “SnapKit” framework.

<ul>

<li>This slightly lowers the size of the app from 19.8 to 19.5 MB.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Various other small improvements in the codebase.</li>

</ul>
