<p>Mac Mouse Fix <strong>3.0.7</strong> addresses several important

bugs.</p>

<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>

<li>App works again on <strong>older macOS versions</strong> (macOS

10.15 Catalina and macOS 11 Big Sur)

<ul>

<li>Mac Mouse Fix 3.0.6 could not be enabled under those macOS versions

because the improved ‘Back’ and ‘Forward’ feature introduced in Mac

Mouse Fix 3.0.6 attempted to use macOS system APIs that weren’t

available.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Fixed issues with <strong>‘Back’ and ‘Forward’</strong> feature

<ul>

<li>The improved ‘Back’ and ‘Forward’ feature introduced in Mac Mouse

Fix 3.0.6 will now always use the ‘main thread’ to ask macOS about which

key-presses to simulate to go back and forward in the app you’re

using.<br />

This can prevent crashes and unreliable behavior in some

situations.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Attempted to fix bug where <strong>settings were randomly

reset</strong> (See these <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22Config%20Reset%20Intermittently%22">GitHub

Issues</a>)

<ul>

<li>I rewrote the code that loads the config file for Mac Mouse Fix to

be more robust. When rare macOS file-system errors occurred, the old

code could sometimes mistakenly think that the config file was corrupt

and reset it to default.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Reduced chances of a bug where <strong>scrolling stops

working</strong>

<ul>

<li>This bug cannot be solved fully without deeper changes, which would

likely cause other problems.<br />

However, for the time being, I reduced the time-window where a

‘deadlock’ can happen in the scrolling system, which should at least

lower the chances of encountering this bug. This also makes the

scrolling slightly more efficient.</li>

<li>This bug has similar symptoms – but I think a different underlying

reason – to the ‘Scroll Stops Working Intermittently’ bug which was

addressed in the last release 3.0.6.</li>

<li>(Thanks to Joonas for the diagnostics!)</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<p>Thanks everyone for reporting the bugs!</p>
