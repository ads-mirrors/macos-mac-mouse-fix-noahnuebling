<p>I’m sorry for the hassle, and I hope everyone is ok with this as a

<hr />

<p>Mac Mouse Fix <strong>3.0.6</strong> makes the ‘Back’ and ‘Forward’

feature compatible with more apps. It also addresses several bugs and

issues.</p>

<h3 id="improved-back-and-forward-compatibility">Improved ‘Back’ and

‘Forward’ Compatibility</h3>

<p>The ‘Back’ and ‘Forward’ mouse button mappings now <strong>work in

more apps</strong>, including:</p>

<ul>

<li>Visual Studio Code, Cursor, VSCodium, Windsurf, Zed, and other code

editors</li>

<li>Many built-in Apple apps such as Preview, Notes, System Settings,

App Store, Music, TV, Books, and Freeform</li>

<li>Adobe Acrobat</li>

<li>Zotero</li>

<li>And more!</li>

</ul>

<p>The implementation is inspired by the great ‘Universal Back and

Forward’ feature in <a

href="https://github.com/linearmouse/linearmouse">LinearMouse</a>. It

should support all apps that LinearMouse does.<br />

Furthermore it supports some apps that normally require keyboard

shortcuts to go back and forward, such as System Settings, App Store,

Apple Notes, and Adobe Acrobat. Mac Mouse Fix will now detect those apps

and simulate the appropriate keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p>Every app that’s ever been <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues?q=state%3Aclosed%20label%3A%22Universal%20Back%20and%20Forward%22">requested

in a GitHub Issue</a> should be supported now! (Thanks for the

feedback!) If you find any apps that don’t work, yet, let me know in a

<a

href="http://redirect.macmousefix.com/?target=mmf-feedback-feature-request">feature

request</a>.</p>

<h3

id="addressing-the-scroll-stops-working-intermittently-bug">Addressing

the ‘Scroll Stops Working Intermittently’ Bug</h3>

<p>Some users experienced an <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20stops%20working%20label%3A%22Scroll%20Stops%20Working%20Intermittently%22">issue</a>

where <strong>smooth scrolling stops working</strong> at random.</p>

<p>While I’ve never been able to reproduce the issue, I’ve implemented a

potential fix:</p>

<p>The app will now retry multiple times when setting up

display-synchronization fails.<br />

If it still doesn’t work after retrying, the app will:</p>

<ul>

<li>Restart the ‘Mac Mouse Fix Helper’ background process, which may

resolve the issue</li>

<li>Produce a crash report, which may help diagnosing the bug</li>

</ul>

<p>I hope the problem is finally fixed now! If not, let me know in a <a

href="http://redirect.macmousefix.com/?target=mmf-feedback-bug-report">bug

report</a> or via <a

href="http://redirect.macmousefix.com/?target=mailto-noah">email</a>.</p>

<h3 id="improved-free-spinning-scroll-wheel-behavior">Improved

Free-Spinning Scroll Wheel Behavior</h3>

<p>Mac Mouse Fix will <strong>no longer speed-up scrolling for

you</strong>, when you let the scroll wheel spin freely on the MX Master

mouse. (Or any other mouse with a free-spinning scroll wheel.)</p>

<p>While this ‘scroll speedup’ feature is useful on regular scroll

wheels, on a free-spinning scroll wheel it can make things harder to

control.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Mac Mouse Fix is currently not fully

compatible with most Logitech mice, including the MX Master. I plan to

add full support, but it will probably take a while. In the meantime,

the best third-party driver with Logitech support that I know is <a

href="https://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/">SteerMouse</a>.</p>

<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>

<li>Fixed an issue where Mac Mouse Fix would sometimes re-enable

keyboard shortcuts that were previously disabled in System

Settings<br />

</li>

<li>Fixed a crash when clicking ‘Activate License’</li>

<li>Fixed a crash when clicking ‘Cancel’ right after clicking ‘Activate

License’ (Thanks for the report, Ali!)</li>

<ul>

introduced in <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/releases/tag/3.0.5">3.0.5</a></li>

<li>Text on the ‘Free days are over’ notification is no longer cut off

<li>Disabled Touch Bar text completion on the ‘Enter Your License Key’

screen</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where some symbols displayed in the app had the wrong

color after switching between dark/light mode</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="other-improvements">Other Improvements</h3>

<ul>

<li>Made some animations, such as the tab-switch animation, slightly

more efficient<br />
