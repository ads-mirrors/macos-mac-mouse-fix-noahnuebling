<h1 id="mac-mouse-fix-3-is-here">Mac Mouse Fix 3 is here! ⭐️</h1>

<p>3.0.0 is the <strong>biggest update ever</strong> for Mac Mouse

Fix.<br />

Bringing together many features that I’ve worked on for a long time to

finally deliver this awesome value proposition:</p>

<p><strong>Make your $10 mouse better than an Apple

Trackpad!</strong></p>

<h2 id="mac-mouse-fix-3-is-no-longer-100-free">Mac Mouse Fix 3 is no

longer 100% free</h2>

<p>Mac Mouse Fix 2 remains <strong>100% free</strong>, and I plan to

keep supporting it.</p>

<p>Mac Mouse Fix 3 is <strong>free for 30 days</strong> and then costs

<strong>$2.99</strong> to own.<br />

(That’s the price in August 2025. I might adjust the price down the

line.)</p>

<p>I know that monetization might not seem good for users at first

glance, but I hope I’ve implemented it in a way that everyone can get on

board with.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>It’s pressure-free</strong> Your free days are only used up

when you actually use Mac Mouse Fix. So there’s no pressure to use the

app before the time is up, and you can make an informed decision whether

you want to buy the app or not without any stress.</li>

<li><strong>It syncs via iCloud</strong> Your license is synced via

iCloud, so it will automatically be available on all your

computers!</li>

<li><strong>It’s convenient</strong><br />

Paying for the app and activating your license is super fast and

intuitive. And you can even pay with <strong>Apple Pay</strong>!</li>

<li><strong>It’s cute</strong><br />

After you activate your license, there’s a cute randomized <strong>thank

you message</strong> on the “About” tab :)</li>

<li><strong>You support the project</strong><br />

By supporting the project financially, you allow me to keep working

toward my dream of making Mac Mouse Fix the best mouse driver <em>of all

time</em>! 🚀</li>

</ul>

<p>If you already bought me a milkshake via PayPal – thank you! Click <a

href="https://redirect.macmousefix.com/?locale=en&amp;target=mmf-apply-for-milkshake-license">here</a>

to receive a <strong>free license</strong>.</p>

<p>If you would like to keep using Mac Mouse Fix 2 – that’s okay as

well. It will remain free forever and I plan to make sure that it keeps

working on future macOS versions.</p>

<p>I hope everyone feels okay about monetization in Mac Mouse Fix 3 and

<strong>thank you</strong> for your support so far! :)</p>

<h2

id="switching-back-to-mac-mouse-fix-2-after-trying-mac-mouse-fix-3">Switching

back to Mac Mouse Fix 2, after trying Mac Mouse Fix 3</h2>

<p>You can try out MMF 3, and go back to MMF 2 at any time. However,

<strong>installing MMF 3 will delete your MMF 2 settings</strong>.

Here’s how to <strong>avoid losing your MMF 2 settings</strong> when

trying out MMF 3:</p>

<p><strong>Before updating to MMF 3:</strong> 1. Open the ‘More…’ screen

in MMF 2, then click the MMF logo in the top left while holding Command

(⌘) and Shift (⇧) on your keyboard. This will reveal a file called

‘config.plist’ in the Finder. This file contains all your settings. 2.

Save a copy of ‘config.plist’ to restore later. 3. Update to MMF 3, and

see if you like it!</p>

<p><strong>When you want to go back to MMF 2:</strong> 1. <a

href="https://redirect.macmousefix.com/?locale=en&amp;target=mmf2-latest">Download

MMF 2</a> again. 2. Reveal ‘config.plist’ in Finder and replace it with

the copy you made earlier.</p>

<p><em>If MMF 2 doesn’t enable after going back to it, you might have to

delete MMF 3, then empty the trash, and then restart your

computer.</em></p>

<p>I hope this gives you peace of mind when trying MMF 3.</p>

<h2 id="new-features-in-mac-mouse-fix-3">New features in Mac Mouse Fix

3!</h2>

<p>Mac Mouse Fix 3 features amazing <strong>new trackpad-like

scrolling</strong>, a beautiful <strong>new UI</strong>, and it lets you

<strong>do anything you can do on a trackpad</strong> by introducing a

few new gestures.</p>

<p><strong>See it in action:</strong> Visit the <a

href="https://macmousefix.com">new website</a> for video demos of all

the features.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed changelog:</strong> View the release notes for <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/releases/tag/3.0.0-Beta-7">3.0.0

Beta 7</a> and previous betas, to find out everything that changed.</p>

<p><strong>Most important new features:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><p><strong>‘Click and Drag’ to ‘Scroll &amp; Navigate’</strong></p>

<p>You can now click and drag to simulate swiping with 2 fingers on an

Apple trackpad. This lets you breeze through the system as it allows you

to scroll really precisely and flexibly in 360°, go back and forward in

Safari, delete mails quickly, and much more.</p>

<p>You can even use <a

href="https://highlyopinionated.co/swish/">Swish</a> right from your

mouse. It’s a really nice app that’s designed to let you manage your

windows by swiping on the trackpad. But now, you can use it with your

mouse, too! - In fact, anything you can do by swiping on a trackpad

works just as well with Mac Mouse Fix!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>‘Click and Scroll’ gestures</strong></p>

<p>You can now hold a mouse button and then scroll to trigger many

different actions, such as showing the desktop, zooming in or out, and

much more. It feels super responsive and fluid, just like a

trackpad.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Completely rebuilt scrolling</strong></p>

<p>Scrolling now requires less effort and feels much smoother and more

fun to use. It can also simulate swiping on a trackpad. This brings some

small niceties such as a little bounce when you reach the end of a page,

being able to go back and forward in Safari by scrolling horizontally,

better compatibility with Preview.app, and more.</p>

<p>Visit the <a href="https://macmousefix.com/#scroll">scrolling

section</a> on the new website to see the new scrolling in action.

Though I think it’s best to just try it yourself!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Awesome new UI</strong></p>

<p>The app’s UI has also been completely rebuilt to be more beautiful,

powerful, and intuitive. It can also be translated into other languages

now and it’s already available in Chinese, Korean, and German.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Menu bar item</strong></p>

<p>There’s now a menu bar item that you can enable if you like, which

lets you see when Mac Mouse Fix is active, and it looks sleek.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Do anything you can do on a trackpad</strong></p>

<p>If you’re using a 3-button mouse, I think the biggest difference

between MMF 2 and MMF 3 in your daily experience will be the scrolling.

But if you use a 5-button mouse, I think MMF 3 is quite transformative,

because it really lets you do anything you can do on a trackpad with

simple and intuitive gestures on your mouse. For example, Click and

Scroll to <em>Zoom in or out</em>, Click and Drag to go <em>Back and

Forward</em> in Safari, and much more.</p>

<p>Visit the <a href="https://macmousefix.com/#trackpad">trackpad

section</a> on the new website to see these new trackpad-like gestures

in action.</p></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="changes-since-the-last-beta">Changes since the last Beta</h2>

improvements over 3.0.0 Beta 7:</p>

<ul>

<li>Slightly reduced CPU usage of “Scroll &amp; Navigate” feature</li>

<li>Added “Version” in front of the version number on the “About” tab to

make it easier to understand</li>

<li>Updated the license string of the “Mac Mouse Fix Helper” app</li>

<li>Improved fallback mechanism for license-related values when there is
