    ///             One day I was kinda stressed out n angry and wanted to scan pages for something I was looking for. So you make lots of quick, large scrolls, followed by pauses to scan the page visually. The ease-out animation after the quick large scrolls felt a bit too long.

    ///         IIRC, the 'speed' (sensitivity/acceleration) gets lower as you lower the smoothness. IIRC, this is because shortAnimations + high 'speed' means content moves so fast that it becomes jarring/disorientating for the eyes.

    ///         Idea: Dynamically increase animation duration on large 'swipes' such that content doesn't move so fast as to be jarring. Then you could perhaps turn up the 'speed' for 'Smoothness: Regular'.

I generally prefer slower animation today and am Happy with Option 3. - Perhaps cause I'm more tired/relaxed than the last days. Update: Actually using 0.85 seems to solve the problem without making other stuff feel weird I think ... Update2: Nah 0.85 makes the speed feel 'inconsistent'. Update3: I played around with Firefox today and it also feels 'inconsistent'. The mostly linear animation curve is good because it keeps the animations speed steady and directly tied to the speed of the user's finger movement. But perhaps a hybrid solution where we have a smooth ease-out for slow finger movements but become close-to-linear at medium and fast finger movements would solve this.

Update 2: Actually with 15 frames it feels even better. Maybe we can keep the linear speedup curve like that.

        /// - The reason why we introduced a curve, is that when we tried linear interpolation for the baseMsPerStepMin, we found that little 2-3 tick swipes were too fast, but larger/faster swipes were too slow. Initially, we tried to fix that by adding additional smoothing inside ScrollAnalyzer by initializing the `_tickTimeSmoother` with a value. However, this messed up the scroll distance acceleration, so we turned that back off. This curve is our second attempt at making the 2-3 tick swipes animate slower while making the larger or faster swipes animate faster. In contrast to the previous ScrollAnalyzer-based approach, this approach doesn't have a time component, where if you scroll at the same speed for a longer time it speeds up more. Not sure if this is a good or bad thing.
        /// - The curve we're using (at the time of writing) is basically just a shifted and scaled exponential function. I designed it using this desmos page: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/l8plcdlpmn. I first tried using a Bezier curve, but it didn't get curved enough. I thought about using a curve based on 1/x instead of e^x, but they looked very similar in desmos and e^x is simpler to deal with.
        /// 
        /// - Sidenotes:
        ///     - It's overall a little messy that we have these hybrid curves whose duration we can't directly control, but then we create complex curves for the duration of the baseCurve of the HybridCurve to gain back some control of the overall duration. It's sort of messy and confusing. All in the name of having the deceleration feel 'physical'. (That's the purpose of the HybridCurves) I mean this is still the best feeling scrolling algorithm I know of so I guess it works, but I really wonder if it wouldn't have been possible to design something more elegant. Maybe we could've done a sort of spring animator and then dynamically chose the starting speed such that the animation covers a certain distance in a certain time. That's the thing we really want to have explicit control over: The distance. But we also want to have control over the feel and over the duration. However, if you want to have a 'physical' feel it's complicated to also control the distance and duration. And actually in case of the high smoothness curves I think I'm pretty happy not having to explicitly control the duration. The duration just falls out of the physics in a nice way. Update: Stared at Desmos for a while and came to the conclusion that our current idea is the best and with spring animations we'd have more or less the same problem. (Can't easily control both duration and distance while keeping consistent physics)
        ///
        /// - **Ideaaa**: It seems that what I'm currently trying to to when designing these curves is 1. Make the animations speed for fastest scrollwheel movements as fast as possible without becoming disorientating to look at 2. Adjust the animation speed for lower scrollwheel speed to feel 'the same' or 'consistent' with the fastest scrollwheel speed - because the 'consistent' feel makes it easier to control. (I'm not sure what consistent means, it's just a feeling) --- Maybe we could do this stuff explicitly somehow. Like explicitly cap the animation speed. Update: Just measured the overall animation duration (including drag) after finding a `baseMsPerStepCurve` that feels 'consistent' to us and I found the duration is relatively close to being constant! It's currently between 260 and 300 ms - This gives me the idea that what we were subconsciously doing with the `baseMsPerStepCurve` was to try and make the overall animation duration constant. Maybe that's what made it feel 'consistent' to us. Update: Also did some testing for curves that feel 'inconsistent' to us and the variation in overall animation duration wasn't thatt much more as I thought. I think what I observed was like 240 to 340 ms. Maybe this means that the 'consistent' feel has other aspects aside from low variation in overall animation duration.
        ///     - **Implementation Ideas**: These thoughts give me two concrete ideas for potentially improving our scrolling algorithms:
        ///         1. Idea: Make a way to create a `HybridCurve` with a fixed duration along with a fixed distance. The HybridCurve should then automatically figure out what the baseCurve should be / how fast the baseMsPerStep should be. Having explicit control over the duration might allow us to create better, more 'consistent' feeling and more controllable curves. I don't think we'd want to use this for High Smoothness scrolling, since there we want a large variability in animation duration, and the way the current algorithms behave feels very natural and predictable to me already. But for the regular smoothness setting (Which uses this code right here), this could potentially be nice. But on the other hand, maybe the bit of variability in animation duration is good? I'm not sure. Butt, if we implemented a system for explicitly controlling the animation duration, we could still vary the animation duration with the animation distance or with the scrollwheel speed. We'd simply have more control over it, which I think really couldn't hurt?
        ///             - Conclusion: This idea is interesting. I think it would be good to try at some point. But to really ship this, we'd have to be careful and dedicate a lot of time to testing. I think for now, the current approach of defining a `baseSpeedupCurve` to get some control over the scroll animation duration seems like it's good enough. Maybe it's even inherently better than this idea. I'm not sure. That's why I should test it at some point. But not now.
        ///         2. Idea: Make a way to explicitly specify a maxAnimationSpeed(Target) which is the highest speed where your eyes can follow scrolling content on the screen (This probably depends on screen refresh rate and other stuff, but we can assume our own screen as a heuristic I think). The duration of the animation curve could then be dynamically determined to be such that, when the user does a scroll swipe at max speed, the resulting animation has a max speed of maxAnimationSpeed(Target). Note that this means we'd choose different animation durations for different "Scrolling Speed" user settings that the user might choose (These user settings really determine sensitivity to be precise) . As a simpler-to-implement stand-in for such a mechanism, we could simply scale the baseMsPerStep with the accelerationCurve. E.g. we could desing the baseMsPerStep around the mediumSpeed accelerationCurve, then sample both the mediumSpeed accelerationCurve and the currentSpeed accelerationCurve at let's say 80% of the maximum scrollwheel speed that the user can input, and then get the scaling factor `s` between the 80% values of those two curves. Then we could multiply the baseMsPerStep with `s`. That way we only have to find a suitable baseMsPerStep for the mediumSpeed accelerationCurve and the rest would be adjusted such that the user can produce an animation speed of *up to* maxAnimationSpeed(Target) no matter what "Scrolling Speed" setting they choose.
        ///             - Sidenote: I'm putting "Target" in `maxAnimationSpeed(Target)` because it's not supposed to be a hard cap for the animation speed it's more like a heuristic saying: if the user inputs the fastest scroll they can, then the movement on the screen should be about this fast.
        ///             - Conclusion: I think this is an idea worth exploring, especially when we introduce more options for the user to choose a "Scrolling Speed".  However, this would need a lot of testing to make sure we're getting it right, and I should only do it if I have time to dedicate to this. So not now.
        ///
        /// - Idea:
        ///     - What's interesting is that the animationDuration is influenced by both the baseMsPerStep speed up mechanism as well as by the Drag physics inside the HybridCurve. But at the time of writing, the baseMsPerStep speed up is applied purely based on timeBetweenscrollwheelTicks, while the animationDuration modification from the drag physics is applied based on how many pixels are left to scroll. (Which is also a result of the timeBetweenscrollwheelTicks but with an additional time component I think). This is quite messy to think about. Based on these thoughts, I would think that the animationDuration is very unpredictable. But in practise it doesn't feel that way.

        ///     - I liked 4.0, 140.0, 60.0 for a while - It feels super direct and immediate. And still smoother than Chrome. However I found that it's hard to follow scrolling movements with your eyes at least on my displays.

But, I really think this is at the upper end of animation speed that is nice to use, and the responsiveness is noticably better than pre 3.0.1. Controllability is also better I think.
        ///             - You'd think that the whole baseCurveSpeedup and curvature stuff would make the scrolling less predictable/controllable. Not totally sure, but I feel like for this curve if we turn the speedup off it becomes harder to control/predict. Update: I looked at the overall animation duration (including DragCurve and BaseCurve) and there's less variation in that with this speedup mechanism. Maybe decreased variability makes things more predictable / easy to control. See **Ideaaa** above for more on this.

From my testing, at 0.4 it becomes sluggish feeling. Edit: From more testing, I think 0.15 makes especially single ticks a bit smoother, and doesn't noticably impact responsiveness. I did some performance testing, since with speedSmoothing, the BezierCurves can't be optimized into simple straight lines anymore. Scrolling to the bpm of a song the CPU usage went from 1.2% -> 1.6% percent. That's a 30% increase, but it's still very fast. Currently we're using an epsilon of 0.01 for the BezierCurves. If we lower that we might get even better performance, but it already gives slightly different curves in MOS scroll analyzer with this epsilon compared to more accurate epsilon, so I don't think we should make it lower.

(I don't think it should be performance intensive enough to make a difference though, but who knows?)

    /**
     
     General thoughts / explanation on how our BezierCappedAccelerationCurve class works in this context:
     
      Define a curve describing the relationship between the inputSpeed (in scrollwheel ticks per second) (on the x-axis) and the sensitivity (In pixels per tick) (on the y-axis).
      We'll call this function y(x).
      y(x) is composed of 3 other curves. The core of y(x) is a BezierCurve *b(x)*, which is defined on the interval (xMin, xMax).
      y(xMin) is called yMin and y(xMax) is called yMax
      There are two other components to y(x):
      - For `x < xMin`, we set y(x) to yMin
      - We do this so that the acceleration is turned off for tickSpeeds below xMin. Acceleration should only affect scrollTicks that feel 'consecutive' and not ones that feel like singular events unrelated to other scrollTicks. `self.consecutiveScrollTickIntervalMax` is (supposed to be) the maximum time between ticks where they feel consecutive. So we're using it to define xMin.
      - For `xMax < x`, we lineraly extrapolate b(x), such that the extrapolated line has the slope b'(xMax) and passes through (xMax, yMax)
      - We do this so the curve is defined and has reasonable values even when the user scrolls really fast
      - (Our uses of tick and step are interchangable here)
     
      HyperParameters:
      - `curvature` raises sensitivity for medium scrollSpeeds making scrolling feel more comfortable and accurate. This is especially nice for very low minSens.
