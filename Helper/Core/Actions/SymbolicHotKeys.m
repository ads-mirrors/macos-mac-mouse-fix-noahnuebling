/**
    System features such as 'Open Mission Control' have an associated identifier which is called the *SymbolicHotKey* or SHK.
    In macOS' APIs, *SymbolicHotKeys* are used to map keyboard shortcuts and mouse buttons to the associated system features.
    
    We hijack the SHK system to trigger macOS features programmatically.
    
    Steps: (Nov 2024)
         1. Look up which keyboard shortcut is associated with the system feature we want to trigger
         2. (If there is no usable keyboard shortcut, modify the `keyboard shortcut -> system feature` map.)
         3. Simulate the keyboard shortcut – which will trigger the desired system feature
         4. (In case it was modified - reset the `keyboard shortcut -> system feature` map.)
         
    Alternatives:
        - There are also SHKs for mouse buttons – not only for keyboard shortcuts. We could possibly use those directly.
            (Src: the `type: button` entries inside ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist)
        - In IOKit there's `IOHIDEventCreateSymbolicHotKeyEvent()` - this sounds like a promising way to simplify triggering of SHKs
            (But we'd first have to figure out how to use that function and how to convert from `IOHIDEvent` to `CGEvent`, so it might take a while.)
            (Also see `CGEventHIDEventBridge.h`)
        - Public HIToolbox APIs such as`CopySymbolicHotKeys()`
            I think these are more for registering new SHKs for the current app, not for modifying/triggering global SHK – but I haven't tested them, yet.
    
     Discussion:
         We implemented the SymbolicHotKey stuff really early in development (for MMF 1) the Apple Note below documents some of our thinking at the time.
    
    ----------------------------------------------
    
     Original Apple Note from 22.11.2018:
     
        Switching Spaces through Private API

        - [x] SOLVED - using symbolic hotkey private api

        Ways to go forward:
        * Try to really understand how other apps do it
        * Use CGSConnection.h to create custom symbolic hotkey, which we then trigger via CGEvent
            * private API not fully documented, pretty sure that we’d have to overridde existing hotkey, and/or activate it globally
        * Find way to make CGSSpace.h work properly
            * feel like I tried everything
        * Try to find, reverse engineer and emulate executable that parses symbolic hotkeys
            * (**harrrrrd**)

        Keyboard Shortcut Preferences File
        /Users/Noah/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist

        control key mask:
        * 0x040000:	262144
        * 0x840000:	8650752

        * left space: 		79
        * right space:		81
        * mission control: 	32
        * show all windows: 	33

        GitHub Projects that can do it:

            * [Demo of Spaces API discovered through RE](https://gist.github.com/puffnfresh/4054059) - old, no switching
            * [Spaces.h](https://github.com/NUIKit/CGSInternal/blob/master/CGSSpace.h) - “header for private Spaces Routines”

            * [hs._asm.undocumented.spaces](https://github.com/asmagill/hs._asm.undocumented.spaces) - Hammerspoon module for Space Switching functionality (built on Spaces.h) - relies on killing Dock, no animtions
            * [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/tree/0.9.70) - “bridge between macOS and Lua Lang” (built on hs._asm.)

            * [Silica](https://github.com/ianyh/Silica/blob/master/Silica/CGSSpaces.h) - “window management framework” (interacts with private API but doesn't do space switching I believe)
            * [Amethyst](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst) - “window manager app” - “built on Silica”

    ///     - If we create an NSString directly with the controlCharacters it prints using ASCII caret notation. e.g. `kFunctionKeyCharCode` prints as `\^P` (See Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret_notation)
    ///     - Interesting: All the ASCII control characters I've seen UCKeyTranslate output correspond with 'MacRoman' character codes found in an HIToolbox enum. The 'MacRoman' character names also seem to correspond with the pressed key.
    ///         - E.g. Pressing F11 produces the `kFunctionKeyCharCode` MacRoman character.
    ///         - Many of the MacRoman characters also line up with the ASCII control characters semantically. E.g. `kReturnCharCode == 13 == (carriage return)`
    ///             (where `kReturnCharCode` is the macRoman character and `(carriage return)` is an ASCII control character.)
    ///
    ///     - If we use `[NSEvent -charactersByApplyingModifiers:]` instead of UCKeyTranslate, we get `NS` constants instead of these macRoman characters when pressing non-character-generating keys. E.g. `NSBackspaceCharacter` or `NSF7FunctionKey`.
    ///         - Use cases: These `NS` constants seem well-suited for displaying a kb-key / shortcut in the UI for users (Maybe we can use it in place of the code we copied from MASShortcut in MMF?). The HIToolBox MacRoman constants don't really seem useful for much – so we're filtering them out.
    ///         - My feeling: For our lower-level, non-UI, kb-shortcut code, I think we should use vkc's to identify non-character-generating keys.

    ///             IIRC, This is also how macOS seems to handle things – at least for system-wide keyboard shortcuts – looking at the output of `CGSGetSymbolicHotKeyValue()` – it seems to set the keyEquivalent to `UINT16_MAX` unless it's a normal ascii character, and otherwise uses the VKC (IIRC).
